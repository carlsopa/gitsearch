### Git searcher

## intro
If you are reading this, that means you probably use github.  Its an amazing place that allows developers, engineers, programmers and anyone else who wants to share data and code to do so.  It is also a great oppurtunity to find new libraries, and open source projects that you may be interested in helping with.

However, since you can do all that github is vast and full of projects and ideas.  That is where Git Search comes in, it will allow you to see what your freinds are up to at a quick glance.

The project came about as a prompt from the twice weekly hackathon put on mintbean.io.
